# Jupyter On GCP
---------------------------
 
This short post is about how to quickly get set up with Jupyter notebook on the Google Cloud Platform. I wrote this as a tutorial as part of a guest lecture on Numerical Linear Algebra, you can see that lecture here.

In this post I will show you how to get set up using Jupyter on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and install many of the Python packages I will use in my lecture. Using Google Cloud allows us to use Python and Jupyter notebook without needing to install anything on your computer or worry about different hardware requimrments or operating systems. All that is needed is access to web browser (preferrably Chrome) and to sign up for the free trial to GCP. We should be able to start and access this notebook from anywhere that has internet connection! I won't be going over fancy tricks or worry too much about security, but rather show the minimum to getting up and running with Jupyter on GCP.
